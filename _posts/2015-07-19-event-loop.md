A good example for this is [Paypal](http://www.paypal.com/). Lately they switched their codebase from Java to Node because of the advantages from async style of programming. Exploring further I found about MEAN stack 
, Meteorjs which is a super effiecient way to make 'SPA' s. With the formation of Node foundation I guess Node
will have a better future taking over the web with javascript.
