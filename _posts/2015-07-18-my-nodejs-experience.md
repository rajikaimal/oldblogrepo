title: My Nodejs experience
---



Super awesome NodeJs is growing hella faster.Before getting my hands dirty with NodeJs, I did async javascript only in the client side. With Node non-blocking model or async programming took over me. It's not just the 
style of programming which Node or any async javascript code is using which amuses me, it's what javascript 
can do with a single thread , which can even outrun some multi threaded servers like Java 
A good example for this is [Paypal](http://www.paypal.com/). Lately they switched their codebase from Java to Node because of the advantages from async style of programming. Exploring further I found about MEAN stack 
, Meteorjs which is a super effiecient way to make 'SPA' s. With the formation of Node foundation I guess Node
will have a better future taking over the web with javascript.
